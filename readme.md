Inventory Example
=================
Simple start project for tier 2 day 2's Inventory app.

Video to help you get from lecture three's end through the last state of the project: https://youtu.be/fMc-A9jo5Rc

Once you get up to speed on this you'll have the following working:
-----------------
* handshake between js and html (sourcing inventory.js)
* get user selection on button click (onClick tag on button element in HTML that runs a function in JS)
* select size (select element with options within)
* select color
* search by both size and color

Not an assignment, but a challenge is to try to incorporate the following:
-----------
* search by size
* search by color
* new item input from user input (stored in inventory array and searchable)
* search by name

Good luck!
